Absolutely, Sean — this is the perfect moment to reset the trajectory and build something intentional, structured, and *aligned with who you are becoming*, not who your old resume was written for.

You’re not drifting toward Senior Data Engineering — you’re **architecting** your way there.  
Let’s give that architecture a name worthy of the mission.

# 🚀 **The Girgis Data Engineering Ascension Roadmap (G‑DEAR)**  
A structured, iterative, career‑building roadmap designed for your transition into Senior Data Engineering — while simultaneously upgrading your resume, portfolio, and job‑search momentum every single week.

This will be our shared reference point moving forward.

# 🧭 **G‑DEAR: The Girgis Data Engineering Ascension Roadmap**

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy**
- **Learn → Build → Publish → Apply**  
- Every week produces:
  - A new skill
  - A small project or artifact
  - A resume update
  - A website update
  - A batch of job applications  
- You don’t wait until you’re “ready.”  
  You *become* ready by shipping continuously.

# 🏗️ **Phase 1 — Foundations of a Senior Data Engineer**
These are the pillars that make you dangerous in interviews and effective on the job.

## 1️⃣ **ETL, Feature Engineering & Core Algorithms**
- Python mastery (clean code, modularity, testing)
- SQL (window functions, CTEs, performance tuning)
- Data structures & algorithms relevant to DE:
  - Hashing
  - Sorting
  - Streaming
  - Partitioning
  - Memory‑efficient transforms
- Build 2–3 ETL mini‑pipelines

## 2️⃣ **Python Data Engineering Stack**
- Pandas → Polars (for speed)
- Data validation (pydantic, pandera)
- Reporting & visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Logging, error handling, retry logic
- Packaging your code (poetry, pipx)
- Add: **Airflow or Prefect** (critical for DE)

## 3️⃣ **Machine Learning (DE‑focused)**
Not to be a data scientist — but to support ML pipelines:
- Feature stores
- Model versioning
- Batch vs streaming inference
- MLflow basics
- Build a simple ML pipeline end‑to‑end

---

# 🏗️ **Phase 2 — Big Data Engineering**
## 4️⃣ **PySpark, Glue, and Data Lakes**
- Spark fundamentals (RDD → DataFrame → SQL)
- Partitioning, bucketing, file formats (Parquet, ORC)
- Glue ETL jobs
- Lakehouse patterns (Delta Lake / Iceberg)
- Build a Spark pipeline on sample data

## 5️⃣ **AWS for Data Engineering**
- S3, IAM, Lambda, Glue, Athena, Step Functions
- Kinesis vs MSK
- Redshift vs Snowflake (conceptual)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or CDK)
- Build a small AWS data pipeline

## 5.5️⃣ **AI‑Augmented Engineering**
- Agentic workflows (LangChain, LlamaIndex)
- Retrieval pipelines
- AI‑assisted code generation
- Build an AI‑powered ETL assistant or data‑quality agent

---

# 🧩 **Phase 3 — Analytics Engineering**
## 6️⃣ **Tableau & Power BI**
- Build dashboards from your own pipelines
- Publish 3–5 portfolio dashboards
- Add a “Data Engineering → Analytics” story to your resume

---

# 🌐 **Phase 4 — Portfolio, Resume, and Public Presence**
## 7️⃣ **Website Enhancement**
Your site becomes your *Data Engineering Lab*:
- Weekly article/tutorial
- Project write‑ups
- Architecture diagrams
- Code snippets
- Blog posts on:
  - Spark optimization
  - ETL patterns
  - AWS Glue
  - Polars vs Pandas
  - Data modeling

Your site becomes a living resume.

---

# 🧪 **Interview Mastery Track**
We’ll build:
- A DE interview question bank
- Behavioral stories (STAR)
- System design patterns:
  - Data lake ingestion
  - Batch vs streaming
  - Orchestration
  - Scaling pipelines
- Whiteboard‑style ETL design practice
- SQL + Python challenge practice

---

# 💼 **Job Search Momentum Track**
You will:
- Apply weekly (even while learning)
- Tailor resume bullets to what you learned that week
- Add micro‑projects to GitHub continuously
- Build a recruiter‑friendly LinkedIn profile
- Create a “Senior Data Engineer in Progress” narrative

This is how you get interviews *before* you feel “ready.”

---

# 📅 **Weekly Cadence (The Engine of G‑DEAR)**

## **Every Week You Will Produce:**
- 1 new skill
- 1 small project or code artifact
- 1 resume update
- 1 website update
- 10–20 job applications

This creates unstoppable forward motion.

---

# 🔥 **Next Step**
I can turn G‑DEAR into:
- A 12‑week plan  
- A 6‑month plan  
- A daily checklist  
- A Notion database  
- A skill‑tracking dashboard  
- A resume rewrite aligned with Senior DE roles  

Which format do you want to build first so we can start executing immediately?
