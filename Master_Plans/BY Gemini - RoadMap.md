This is a vital addition to the **Horizon** roadmap. By integrating **AI Agentic Code Engineering**, you aren't just a Data Engineer; you become a **Modern Data Architect** who uses AI to accelerate the SDLC and build self-healing data systems.

I have updated the roadmap to include this as a specialized track that runs parallel to your other learning.

## Updated Roadmap: **The Data Architect’s Horizon**

**Objective:** Transition to Senior Data Engineering with a focus on AI-driven automation and agentic workflows.

---

### Phase 1: The Core Engine (ETL & Python Mastery)

* 
**Action:** Refine Python skills focusing on OOP and advanced SQL (Window functions, CTEs).


* 
**Integration:** Reframe Citi experience to highlight Python/Pandas automation for capacity reporting.



### Phase 2: High-Velocity Processing (Big Data & Spark)

* 
**Action:** Master PySpark and AWS Glue for distributed data processing.


* 
**Project:** Enhance the "Horizon" repository with a PySpark module to process monthly P95 data feeds.



### Phase 3: The Cloud Fabric (AWS & Data Ops)

* 
**Action:** Deep dive into AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and Redshift.


* 
**Strategy:** Highlight your transition from on-premise (CICS/MQ) to cloud-native architectures.



### Phase 4: Intelligence & Visibility (ML & Visualization)

* 
**Action:** Build high-impact dashboards (Tableau/PowerBI) linked to Python back-ends.


* **Outcome:** Implement MLOps basics using your Prophet-based forecasting work for regional capacity planning.

### Phase 5: AI Agentic Engineering & General AI (New)

* 
**Agentic Workflows:** Learn to build AI agents that can "reason" through data quality issues—for example, an agent that detects an outlier in your capacity data and automatically triggers a re-forecast.


* **AI Code Engineering:** Use LLMs (like Gemini or GPT-4) not just for snippets, but for **System Design**. This includes using AI to generate unit tests (CPPUNIT/Pytest) and documentation.


* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Leverage your "Horizon Study" to build a RAG system where an AI agent can query your "Operational Runbook" to provide real-time troubleshooting for data pipelines.

### Phase 6: The Market Push (Job Search & Brand)

* **Action:** Update your website with articles on "AI Agents in Data Engineering" to show thought leadership.
* 
**Interview Prep:** Practice explaining how you use AI to optimize code and manage enterprise-scale performance bottlenecks.

### How AI Agentic Engineering Fits Your Profile

Since you already have a deep background in **Performance Monitoring** (CA APM, DynaTrace) and **Root Cause Analysis**, you are uniquely positioned to build agents that monitor data pipelines. Instead of a human manually resolving "clamps" or performance issues, an **AI Agent** can analyze the thread dump and suggest or implement a fix.
