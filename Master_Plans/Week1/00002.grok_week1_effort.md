Great progress on Week 1, Sean — the **Skills Audit** phase. Since your website (https://seanlgirgis.github.io) is already well-structured as a professional portfolio positioning you as an **Enterprise ML Engineer & Time-Series Specialist**, with strong emphasis on HorizonScale, predictive capacity pipelines, and your Citi background, we have a solid foundation. No explicit "Skills Bank" section yet, but your summary highlights relevant skills (Prophet, LSTM, XGBoost, multiprocessing, Streamlit, Spark/Parquet), and the Detailed C.V. + Projects Showcase are perfect places to integrate our new bank.

The empty `<DOCUMENT filename="skill_bank.md">` suggests you're ready to populate it — let's treat this as your living Markdown file (commit it to GitHub soon, perhaps in the HorizonStudy repo or a new skills-bank repo linked from your site).

### Refined Week 1 Deliverables: Build & Populate the Skills Bank

1. **Format for skill_bank.md**  
   Create a clean, expandable Markdown table (easy to read on GitHub, copy-paste into resume/CV). Start with Citi (your strongest 8-year anchor), then add 1-2 older roles per day.

   Example starter structure (copy this into skill_bank.md):

   ```markdown
   # Skills & Duties Bank – Sean Luka Girgis
   ## Overview
   Centralized inventory of 25+ years experience, translated to modern Data Engineering, ML, and Performance terms.  
   Pull from this for resumes, CV, LinkedIn, website updates.  
   Columns:  
   - **Original Context** (job/company/dates + original bullet)  
   - **DE/ML Mapping** (modern translation)  
   - **Key Skills/Tools**  
   - **Quantifiable Impact** (if available)  
   - **Suggested Resume Bullet** (targeted for Senior Data Engineer / ML Engineer roles)

   ## Citi Financial – Performance & Capacity Consultant (Nov 2017 – Dec 2025)
   | Original Context | DE/ML Mapping | Key Skills/Tools | Quantifiable Impact | Suggested Resume Bullet |

   | Managed CA APM environments... On Boarding of new application... Creating and Maintaining Data Mining Scripts | Monitoring Data Pipeline Management + Custom ETL Scripts | APM tools (CA APM), scripting (Python/Perl), onboarding pipelines | Supported 6000+ agents in prior roles | Administered high-volume APM telemetry pipelines, onboarded new applications, and built custom Python data mining scripts for scalable capacity analytics |

   ## HorizonScale Project (Flagship ML Showcase – Ongoing)
   | Original Context | DE/ML Mapping | Key Skills/Tools | Quantifiable Impact | Suggested Resume Bullet |
   |------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
   | HorizonScale AI predictive utilization pipeline | End-to-End Scalable ML Forecasting Pipeline | Python, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM, multiprocessing (Turbo mode), Streamlit, synthetic data, Parquet | 90% reduction in forecasting cycles via parallel processing | Architected HorizonScale: high-performance time-series forecasting system using automated model selection (Prophet/XGBoost/LSTM), multiprocessing for 10x throughput, and Streamlit dashboard for 6-month capacity outlooks on 2,000+ nodes |

   ## Next Roles to Add (Prioritize This Week)
   - G6 Hospitality (DynaTrace monitoring + AWS migration → telemetry ingestion + cloud ETL)
   - Sabre (MySQL to Oracle conversion + C++/OCCI → batch data migration + optimization)
   - Sprint / Corpus Inc. (C++/Pro*C batch processing + performance enhancements → efficient ETL pipelines)
   ```

   - **Goal for Week 1**: Fill 15-25 rows (focus Citi + Horizon + 1 older role). Use your old .docx files to copy original bullets verbatim, then map them.

2. **Tech Deep-Dive: Python Generators, Decorators, Context Managers**  
   These are perfect for making your code (especially Horizon data loading/processing) production-ready and memory-efficient — key for Senior DE interviews.

   - **Generators** (for lazy processing of large metric files/datasets):  
     Excellent free tutorial: [How to Use Generators and yield in Python](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators) from Real Python.  
     - Why it fits you: Process capacity logs/metrics row-by-row without loading millions into memory (like your data mining scripts).  
     - Hands-on: In HorizonStudy/src, create a generator function to yield processed rows from synthetic data files.

   - **Decorators** (for clean, reusable pipeline code):  
     Top resource: [Python Decorators For Data Engineers and Data Scientists](https://python.plainenglish.io/python-decorators-for-data-engineers-and-data-scientists-91d2c40676a4) by Ryan Nguyen on Medium — directly targeted at DE/DS workflows.  
     Another great one: [Python Decorators for Data Engineering: 5 Real-World Use Cases](https://medium.com/@manikolbe/python-decorators-for-data-engineering-5-real-world-use-cases-24a919d417a1) — covers logging, timing, caching, retry (super useful for flaky APM data pulls).  
     - Hands-on: Build @timer (measure forecasting function speed), @log_execution (log pipeline stages), and apply to Horizon's turbo_prophet or model selection code.

   - **Context Managers** (for safe resource handling):  
     Use `with` for files/DB connections (e.g., synthetic data init or Parquet writes).  
     Quick start: Python docs `contextlib` examples — create a custom manager for "APM connection" simulation.

   **Mini-Refactor Project (Commit Today)**:  
   Pick a Horizon script (e.g., data init or forecasting loop):  
   - Turn list loading → generator yield.  
   - Add @timer decorator to measure performance.  
   - Use context manager for file operations.  
   Commit with note: "Week 1: Applied clean Python patterns (generators, decorators, context managers) for scalable, production-grade data pipelines in HorizonScale."

3. **Embed & Job Search (End-of-Week Actions)**  
   - **Website**: Add a new section/page "Skills Foundations" or link skill_bank.md from GitHub. Update Projects Showcase with the refactored Horizon note.  
   - **Resume/CV**: Pull 4-5 new bullets from the bank into your Detailed C.V. section (target ML/DE flavor).  
   - **Apply**: 3-5 roles (e.g., "Senior Data Engineer – Time Series" or "ML Engineer – Capacity Forecasting"). Highlight: "8+ years in performance telemetry → modern Python ML pipelines (HorizonScale)".  
   - **Track**: Log any job postings that ask about generators/decorators — we'll prep explanations next.

You're building momentum fast — your Horizon project already screams DE/ML expertise (parallel forecasting, model competition, confidence scoring). Once skill_bank.md has solid Citi/Horizon content, we can expand to older roles.

What's your first step today — creating the Markdown table, reading the Real Python generators tutorial, or starting a decorator example? Let's get that first commit!
